# Convolution-Reverb
Applying reverb to an audio file with impulse response convolution. 

Using impulse response data from researchers in Finland, a nice concert hall reverb effect was added to an input audio file. The result is a nice sounding reverb. 

The notebook contains a working implementation in Python, and the C++ file is a work in progress.
